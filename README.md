# Simple-Port-Scanner

Creating a README.md file is a common practice to provide information and instructions about a project or code repository. Below is an example of what you might include in a README.md file for a simple port scanning script:

Port Scanner
This Python script allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified IP address to check if they are open or closed.

Prerequisites
	* Python 3.x installed on your machine
	* Basic knowledge of using the command line
Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ashoka__11/simple-port-scanner.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd simple-port-scanner

3. Run the script:
python simple-port_scanner.py

4. Follow the prompts:
	* Enter the target IP address.
	* Provide the starting and ending port numbers to scan.

5. View the results:The script will display whether each port in the specified range is open or closed on the target IP address.
Example

Enter target IP address: 192.168.1.100
Enter starting port number: 80
Enter ending port number: 100
Scanning ports on 192.168.1.100...
Port 80 on 192.168.1.100 is open
Port 81 on 192.168.1.100 is closed
Port 82 on 192.168.1.100 is closed
